# GGSL-Project

The relationship between religion and society is an age-old object of fascination for social scientists. What explains the variation we see in the world's small-scale religious traditions? Are such traditions responses to local threats to cooperation and other forms of sociality? Do traditional beliefs and practices bolster cooperation? Do indigenous religious traditions contribute to the sustained use of resources? Do rituals in these communities convey commitment to other community members? Do traditions change to accommodate and address new challenges? Until now, only a few case studies have systematically detailed how small-scale religious systems contribute to reducing self-interested motivations and encourage sustained, group-beneficial behaviors in locally relevant ways. The GGSL project will contribute to explaining why one of humanity’s most ancient and cherished institutions persists in so many different forms around the globe.
